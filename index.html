                  <h3>Technical Writing</h3>
                  <p>As a marketing writer who also understands technology, I've refined my technical writing skills by creating documentation and other materials to train and inform both technical and non-technical users. I pride myself on my ability to mentally place myself into my reader's position and create easy-to-follow, useful documents. These include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Instruction guides and manuals</li>
                    <li>Code documentation</li>
                    <li>Instructional wiki pages</li>
                    <li>Instructional presentations</li>
                    <li>Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The documents I prepare are typically based on topics my teammates and coworkers ask about. One of my specialties includes step-by-step instructions for configuring web components and building page layouts. This allows my teammates who specialize in content admin to set up webpages that use complex components and effects with minimal help.</p>

                <article>
                  <h3>Proposal Writing and Management</h3>
                  <p>I've coordinated proposal responses, project-managed responses, and written proposal content for submissions to the clients within the following industries:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>State and local governments across the United States</li>
                    <li>Education</li>
                    <li>Healthcare</li>
                    <li>Financial services</li>
                    <li>Energy</li>
                    <li>Architecture/Engineering/Construction</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>My exceptional organization skills equip me to coordinate complex response packages, while my writing skills let me transform SMEs' bullet points and notes into clear, concise RFP answers. I especially love when a SME who may be overwhelmed at the idea of writing final content for a response feels like they can comfortably provide their thoughts and ideas to me so I can help them make their expertise shine within a response.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, I'm mindful not only of RFP formatting and style requirements, but also of organizational style and branding guidelines.</p>
